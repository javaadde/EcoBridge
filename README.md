> ⚠️ **Note:** We're using Tailwind CSS 3.4 instead of v4 due to stability concerns and known bugs in the v4 beta.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note**: This project uses **Tailwind CSS v3.4** for stability and **Flutter 3.x**.

### Prerequisites

- **For Mobile Development:**
  - Flutter SDK (latest stable)
  - Android Studio / VS Code
  - Android device or emulator with Developer Mode enabled

- **For Desktop Development:**
  - Node.js (v18+)
  - npm or yarn
  - Windows

### 📱 Running the Mobile App (Flutter)

1. **Navigate to the mobile directory:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```

2. **Get dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run on your device:**
   - Connect your Android phone via USB.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - Select your device if prompted.

### 🖥️ Running the Desktop App (Electron + Next.js)

1. **Navigate to the desktop directory:**
   ```bash
   cd desktop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode:**
   This command starts both the Next.js renderer and the Electron main process concurrently.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 🤝 Connecting Devices

1. Start the **Desktop App** first (it initializes the discovery server).
2. Open the **Mobile App** on your phone (ensure it's on the same Wi-Fi network).
3. The mobile app should automatically detect the desktop and show "Online".

## 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI)

We use **GitHub Actions** to automatically build and test both the desktop and mobile applications on every push to `main` and on pull requests.

### 🚀 How It Works

The CI pipeline runs two parallel jobs:

#### Desktop Build (Windows)
- **Trigger:** Push to `main`, Pull Requests
- **Environment:** Windows (windows-latest)
- **Steps:**
  1. Checks out the code
  2. Sets up Node.js (v18+)
  3. Runs `npm install` to install dependencies
  4. Runs `npm run build` to build the Electron + Next.js application

#### Mobile Build (Linux)
- **Trigger:** Push to `main`, Pull Requests
- **Environment:** Ubuntu (ubuntu-latest)
- **Steps:**
  1. Checks out the code
  2. Sets up Flutter (v3.16 stable channel)
  3. Runs `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies
  4. Runs `flutter analyze` to perform static code analysis

### 📋 Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) and will:
- ✅ Run automatically on every push to the `main` branch
- ✅ Run automatically on every pull request targeting `main`
- ✅ Fail the build if either job encounters an error
- ✅ Cache dependencies for faster subsequent builds
- ✅ Display results in the PR checks section

### 💡 What This Means for Contributors

When you submit a pull request:
1. The CI workflow will automatically start
2. Both desktop and mobile builds will be compiled and tested
3. Static analysis will check your code for issues
4. The PR will show a ✅ or ❌ status based on results
5. Your code must pass all checks before merging

**Tip:** You can run these commands locally before pushing:
```bash
# For desktop
cd desktop && npm install && npm run build

# For mobile
cd mobile && flutter pub get && flutter analyze
```

## 🎨 Design & Branding

Design is a **core pillar** of EcoBridge. We aren't just building a tool; we're building an **experience**.

### 🎯 Design Focus Areas

- **Brand Identity:** Logo design, iconography, color palette
- **Mobile UI/UX:** Flutter app screens and interactions
- **Desktop Dashboard:** Electron app interface and settings
- **Marketing:** Landing page, social media assets

### 📐 Design Guidelines

| ✅ Encouraged | ❌ Discouraged |
|--------------|---------------|
| Manual designs with thought and iteration | Raw AI-generated outputs |
| Figma or Google Stitch source files | Designs without source files |
| User-tested prototypes | "Hallucinated" UI elements |
| Accessibility considerations | Unreadable color contrasts |

**Submission:** Attach Figma/Stitch links or source files to design issues. AI can inspire, but manual refinement is required.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributors of all skill levels! Whether you're a seasoned developer or making your first open source contribution, there's a place for you here.

### 📚 Essential Reading

Before contributing, please review these documents:

1. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Contribution guidelines and standards
2. **[AIPromptingMasterGuide.md](AIPromptingMasterGuide.md)** - How to effectively use AI tools

### 🚀 Recommended Development Strategies

#### For Beginners
- **Start Small:** Look for `good first issue` labels
- **Focus on One Feature:** Don't try to tackle multiple features at once
- **Ask Questions:** Use issue comments or discussions
- **Read Existing Code:** Learn from implemented patterns

#### Development Workflow
1. **Fork & Clone:** Create your own copy of the repository
2. **Create a Branch:** Use descriptive names like `feature/mdns-discovery` or `fix/gradle-error`
3. **Follow the Style:** Match existing code patterns and design language
4. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify on both mobile and desktop if applicable
5. **Document Changes:** Update relevant docs and add comments
6. **Submit PR:** Include clear description and screenshots/videos for UI changes

### 💡 Feature Implementation Strategies

#### Strategy 1: **Bottom-Up Approach**
Start with foundational components and build upward:
1. Create data models and services
2. Implement business logic
3. Add UI components
4. Integrate everything
5. Polish and optimize

**Good For:** Networking features, data persistence, background services

#### Strategy 2: **Top-Down Approach**
Start with UI and work backward:
1. Design the user interface
2. Create mock data
3. Implement backend logic
4. Connect real data
5. Handle edge cases

**Good For:** New screens, UI features, visual improvements

#### Strategy 3: **Slice Approach**
Implement a minimal end-to-end feature first:
1. Create simplest possible working version
2. Test the integration points
3. Iterate and add complexity
4. Refine and optimize

**Good For:** Complex features with multiple components (e.g., webcam streaming)

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation Tips

#### For Mobile (Flutter)
- Use `flutter pub outdated` to check dependency updates
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing
- Test on physical device, not just emulator
- Handle Android permissions properly (runtime requests)
- Use `const` constructors wherever possible

#### For Desktop (Electron + Next.js)
- Keep renderer process logic separate from main process
- Use IPC for system-level operations
- Test frameless window on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Minimize bundle size (use dynamic imports)
- Implement proper error boundaries

#### For Networking
- Always handle connection failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use timeouts for all network operations
- Test on different network conditions (WiFi, hotspot, slow connection)
- Log errors comprehensively for debugging

### 🎨 Design Guidelines Summary
- we can change this to greyish and add theme switchers as well
**Do:**
- ✅ Pure black (#000000) or very dark backgrounds
- ✅ White elements with subtle opacity (0.05-0.1 borders, 0.6-0.9 text)
- ✅ Rounded corners (24px cards, 20px pills, 30px+ for large elements)
- ✅ Minimal shadows and glows
- ✅ Generous spacing between elements
- ✅ Clean, sans-serif typography

**Don't:**
- ❌ Colorful gradients (purple, blue, etc.)
- ❌ Over-rounded corners (100px border radius on small elements)
- ❌ Nested cards or excessive layering
- ❌ Bright, saturated colors
- ❌ Cluttered interfaces

### 🔧 Common Setup Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Gradle build fails with "Unsupported class file major version"  
**Solution:** Update Gradle wrapper to 8.12.1+ and AGP to 8.6.1+

**Issue:** NDK not found or corrupted  
**Solution:** Delete `~/AppData/Local/Android/sdk/ndk/[version]` and let Gradle re-download

**Issue:** Flutter packages incompatible  
**Solution:** Run `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` carefully

**Issue:** Desktop app won't start  
**Solution:** Clear `node_modules`, run `npm install`, check Electron version compatibility

### 📊 How to Choose What to Work On

1. **Check Milestones:** Start with Phase 1 (The Backbone)
2. **Read Issues:** Look for `help wanted`, `good first issue`, `enhancement` labels
3. **Ask Maintainers:** Comment on issues to claim them=
4. **Improve Existing:** Refactor, optimize, add tests to existing features
